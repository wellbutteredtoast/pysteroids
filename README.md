# pysteriods

pygame-ce Asteriods, a fun little side project of mine, playing around with pygame and a more interactive experience.

## How to play

You move around with **W** to thrust, and **Q** and **E** to rotate your ship.

## The goal

Your goal is to survive as long as you can before taking 5 hits and losing!
